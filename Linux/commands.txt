2) when i a create a new user i want to put 2 imp files in thier home directory
/etc/default/useradd

root@Linux-01:/etc/default# cat useradd
# CLOUD_IMG: This file was created/modified by the Cloud Image build process
# Default values for useradd(8)
#
# The SHELL variable specifies the default login shell on your
# system.
# Similar to DHSELL in adduser. However, we use "sh" here because
# useradd is a low level utility and should be as general
# as possible
SHELL=/bin/bash
#
# The default group for users
# 100=users on Debian systems
# Same as USERS_GID in adduser
# This argument is used when the -n flag is specified.
# The default behavior (when -n and -g are not specified) is to create a
# primary user group with the same name as the user being added to the
# system.
# GROUP=100
#
# The default home directory. Same as DHOME for adduser
# HOME=/home
#
# The number of days after a password expires until the account
# is permanently disabled
# INACTIVE=-1
#
# The default expire date
# EXPIRE=
#
# The SKEL variable specifies the directory containing "skeletal" user
# files; in other words, files such as a sample .profile that will be
# copied to the new user's home directory when it is created.
# SKEL=/etc/skel
#
# Defines whether the mail spool should be created while
# creating the account
# CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes

* SKEL=/etc/skel --> i want to add two files in user home directory by default user was created
* CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes  -->mail file is created in cd /var/mail with the user name
CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=no  -->mail file is not created in cd /var/mail with the user name
cd /var/mail
cd /val/mail
 useradd -N user200
 -N, --no-user-group
           Do not create a group with the same name as the user, but add the user to the group specified by the -g
           option or by the GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd.

           The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified) is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB
           variable in /etc/login.defs.
GROUP=100
 to avaoid the group creation with username we have to give -N option ..,so by default it will bev added to group 100 as specidfied in usedaddd file

-1(any -ve no. specify the in active)
INACTIVE=-1

how to change these values 
from where these values are coming


root@Linux-01:~# cat /etc/login.defs
#
# /etc/login.defs - Configuration control definitions for the login package.
#
# Three items must be defined:  MAIL_DIR, ENV_SUPATH, and ENV_PATH.
# If unspecified, some arbitrary (and possibly incorrect) value will
# be assumed.  All other items are optional - if not specified then
# the described action or option will be inhibited.
#
# Comment lines (lines beginning with "#") and blank lines are ignored.
#
# Modified for Linux.  --marekm

# REQUIRED for useradd/userdel/usermod
#   Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
#   home directory.  If you _do_ define MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE,
#   MAIL_DIR takes precedence.
#
#   Essentially:
#      - MAIL_DIR defines the location of users mail spool files
#        (for mbox use) by appending the username to MAIL_DIR as defined
#        below.
#      - MAIL_FILE defines the location of the users mail spool files as the
#        fully-qualified filename obtained by prepending the user home
#        directory before $MAIL_FILE
#
# NOTE: This is no more used for setting up users MAIL environment variable
#       which is, starting from shadow 4.0.12-1 in Debian, entirely the
#       job of the pam_mail PAM modules
#       See default PAM configuration files provided for
#       login, su, etc.
#
# This is a temporary situation: setting these variables will soon
# move to /etc/default/useradd and the variables will then be
# no more supported
MAIL_DIR        /var/mail
#MAIL_FILE      .mail

# Enable logging and display of /var/log/faillog login failure info.
# This option conflicts with the pam_tally PAM module.

LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB        no

# Enable logging of successful logins

#
# If you have a "write" program which is "setgid" to a special group
# which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the group number and
# TTYPERM to 0620.  Otherwise leave TTYGROUP commented out and assign
# TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.
#
# In Debian /usr/bin/bsd-write or similar programs are setgid tty
# However, the default and recommended value for TTYPERM is still 0600
# to not allow anyone to write to anyone else console or terminal

# Users can still allow other people to write them by issuing

#       UMASK           Default "umask" value.
#
# The ERASECHAR and KILLCHAR are used only on System V machines.
#
# UMASK is the default umask value for pam_umask and is used by
# useradd and newusers to set the mode of the new home directories.
# 022 is the "historical" value in Debian for UMASK
# 027, or even 077, could be considered better for privacy
# There is no One True Answer here : each sysadmin must make up his/her
# mind.
#
# If USERGROUPS_ENAB is set to "yes", that will modify this UMASK default value
# for private user groups, i. e. the uid is the same as gid, and username is
# the same as the primary group name: for these, the user permissions will be
# used as group permissions, e. g. 022 will become 002.

# This variable is used by login and su.
#
#CONSOLE        /etc/consoles

#
# List of groups to add to the user's supplementary group set

# If set to "yes", new passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based

# This variable is deprecated. You should use ENCRYPT_METHOD.

#MD5_CRYPT_ENAB no

ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

#
# Only used if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512.
